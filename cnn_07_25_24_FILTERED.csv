"The """"republican"""" party is the party of cowardice and fear.

They're scared of brown people.
They're scared of black people.
They're scared of gay people.
They're scared of change.
They're scared of electric stoves.
They're scared of beer.
They're scared of rights.
They're scared of humanity.
They're scared of choice.
They're scared of options.
They're scared of freedom.
They're scared of accountability.
They're scared of personal responsibility.
They're scared of human decency.
They're scared of kindness.
They're scared of tolerance.
They're scared of books.
They're scared of smart people.
They're scared of women.
They're scared of voters.

So when they get on tv and talk tough, trying to sound all macho and powerful, if you listen to what they protest, they're screaming out how terrified they are.

"Whatever happened to reporting the truth ? Do they really think we believe everything  that is said? Not everyone is a followerer? Some of us actually think for ourselves. All you have to do is compare how your life was back when Trump was President and look at how things are now. Thse past 4 years has seemed like a horrible nightmare. The fact that an assassination  attempt on Trump should be an eye opener . The democrats have tried everything now to stop Trump  because they don't wont America safe again . They don't care about the safety of our young children or mothers being raped n murdered by eligal immigrants. They don't care about the small business owners who get robbed by 15 plus people at one time. They don't care about the minds of our children being warped by teaching them about transderism . They don't care about giving them filth to read at the age of 9 which is approved by school boards. They don't care that seniors are are losing their benefits because of making 15.00 more than they are allowed to make. They don't care that they took prayer out of school and now there is an abundance of under age killers . These kids deserved to have a better life enriched . Our kids need God's word instilled in them. The democrats don't care about the violence the teachers face or the teachers that have harmed our kids physically and mentally. They don't care about the people struggling to have a good life with what the American dream use to be: a spouse, kids, dog or cat , home .... its all we can do to provide the basics  , food clothing and shelter with help off snap. Let's not forget about our policeman and military. The border crisis has mas resulting in so much death and crimes.. policeman are retiring or quiting at record levels. No one seems to notice that. Our servicemen can't even get acknowledged  when they die but the govmt tries to lie to us that everyone and everything is hunker dorey. America was founded on freedom and religion . What happened that the people got so suppressed  and hateful?  Oh yeah! God was left out. You may not agree on Trumps policy on abortion but is it worth your life being more miserable for the next 4 yrs to vote demacrat or the safety of your little girls or teenage boys lives? Or even your medical and social security be given away to illegal immigrants?

"Remember, Kamala as vice president basically carries out the president's agendas. Biden (possibly due to age) was not as focused on the border and by his nature seemed to be more permissive. Kamala was in prosecution, law enforcement. I'm sure as chief executive she will be more heavy handed with respect to breach of the border, and we can trust on her motives.

"As far as I know, nobody blames divorced politicians for giving a hard time to their kids either because people have an understanding that unfortunate things like divorce may happen. Why am I bringing this up? Many Republicans like MTG, Trump, Boebert, etc. have divorced with multiple children. Evidently, that is not what God intended to happen either. Harris has stepchildren. It is insulting to ignore the fact she probably participated in and contributed to raising those children so stepparents are not parents? Many Republicans are divorced. How is that acceptable by these standards? This individual wants to be the vice president with this very rigid mentality of no lifestyle is acceptable unless he approves of it? That means he will only represent some people but not all people. Why is he so bitter and radical? Btw, it is easy for a guy to have many children but a woman hardly ever achieves a high-level promotion if she has children because she is a caretaker in the first place for years when men have the opportunity to work without interruptions, which ultimately gets held against her at work. I don't know why Harris did not have children. That is only her business but if she had had children, no matter how hard she has worked, she would probably be in a lower-level position now. We could talk about all those unfair things that male politicians don't talk about. I do not want to have a VP who doesn't have the empathy to understand basic things about other people's life situations.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ari6mvykp_c&lc=Ugwy_sFoHjNzMdoe-Nt4AaABAg,@Zsuzsi-eu3pd,CNN,ari6mvykp_c,Hear Buttigieg’s response to Vance’s criticism of childless Democrats,"Former presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg who was speaking to CNN in his personal capacity, responded to past comments from JD Vance about people who don’t have children working in the government in an interview with CNN’s Kaitlan Collins. #CNN #news
