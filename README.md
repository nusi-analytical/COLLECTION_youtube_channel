The purpose of this repository is to store sanitized code from former projects I was involved in
but for which NDAs still apply.  This repo will contain R code that is readily executable with access
to the YouTube API for data collection, OpenAI API for some processing tasks, and a Google account 
for dissimenation of reports/data sets.

References can be provided upon request to clarify the nature of my work if so needed.
